# engagement-tracker

Shows engagement between social, networking, and general body meetings (GBMs)
from 2020 onwards. Need to add visualization for volunteering engagement

- data.csv has all the attendance numbers, with columns "date", "num_attendees",
  "event_name", "incentive", and "category." Will probably add "budget" in there
  as well
- to update this, simply add the entry in data.csv, and it should update
- main.js has the javascript and D3 code.
- d3-tip.js is for the tooltip functionality

To run this locally, install the "Go Live" extension in VS Code and simply click
it to see the website. This is hosted on Jennifer's personal AWS account so
unfortunately the website link cannot be updated by future leadership.
